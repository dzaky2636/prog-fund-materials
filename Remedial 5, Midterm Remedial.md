# Remedial Mission: Logic System Re-evaluation

Hello Cadet, M.E.C.H.A. here. "The Logic Gauntlet" exam was quite challenging, and it seems some signals were disrupted in our logic systems.
No problem. I have prepared a re-evaluation route. This is a shorter and more focused version of the previous exam. The goal is simply to ensure our logic foundations (Flowchart, Selection, Repetition, and Modular) are 100% solid.
After you complete this, we'll reopen "The Gauntlet" for a second attempt. Let's get this done!

## CORE CONCEPTS REVIEW

**Algorithm Definition**: An algorithm is a set of detailed, unambiguous, and ordered instructions developed to describe the processes necessary to produce the desired output from a given input.

**Key Control Structures**:
- **Selection**: Presentation of a condition with choice between two actions based on true/false
- **Repetition**: Repeated execution of statements while a condition is met
- **Modularization**: Breaking programs into smaller, manageable, reusable parts

**Q1: In flowcharts, which symbol do you use for "Input" processes (like `READ value`) and "Output" processes (like `WRITE total`)?**
A. Oval (Terminator)
B. Parallelogram
C. Rectangle
D. Diamond
**Answer: B**

**Q2: Consider the following pseudocode:**
```pseudocode
SET age = 20
IF age > 17 THEN
    WRITE "Adult"
ELSE
    WRITE "Child"
ENDIF
```
What is the output of the code above?
A. Adult
B. Child
C. 20
D. Error
**Answer: A**

**Q3: Which loop is best to use when you already know the exact number of iterations (for example, "repeat 10 times")?**
A. IF-THEN
B. DO-WHILE
C. FOR
D. WHILE
**Answer: C**

**Q4: What is the main benefit of breaking large programs into modules (Modularization)?**
A. Makes programs use less memory.
B. Makes code easier to understand, maintain, and reuse.
C. Eliminates the need to use IF statements.
D. Makes programs run faster.
**Answer: B**

**Q5: When you send a "copy" of data to a module and the original data doesn't change, this is called...**
A. Pass-by-Reference
B. Pass-by-Value
C. Pass-by-Global
D. Pass-by-Module
**Answer: B**
